            <h1>Exploring Twin Lakes Preserve</h1>
            <p><strong> SEPTEMBER 2017</strong> ||| <strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.toh.li/preserves-and-nature-areas/twin-lakes-preserve"><i>Town of Hempstead</i></a></p>
            <p>
                Searching for hiking areas in Long Island, I came across the Twin Lakes Preserve. The photos online were beautiful and although there were only two reviews on Yelp,
                we decided to head there for the weekend. Upon our arrival, at first we had trouble finding the entrance to the reserve. We came across a small opening with a sign
                indicating the nature preserve, so we parked the car nearby and explored the area.</p>
            <p>
                Since there no facilities offered, there were no maps and we were left to navigate the area ourselves. Although each of the two lakes takes about an hour to circle,
                the sheer amount of trees and plants created different paths, making it difficult to navigate the area. We first circled the southern lake, later finding our way
                back to the car to eat lunch. After eating, we decided to hike the second lake, which was much larger.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were not many people in the preserve, other than a biker, two boys fishing, and few people relaxing on the bridge over a small waterfall. Through our hike,
                we encountered a variety of different plants and wildlife, some of which we brought home to further research, and some of which we ate.
            </p>
            <p>
                After about an hour on the second lake, we realized we were lost. We seemed to be circling the same area of the lake. We asked around we there were people, but no
                one seemed to be of help. The weather was not in our favor either, as the scorching heat was dehydrating. Within another hour, we found an exit, and despite it not
                being the opening through which we entered, we exited the preserve. The roads were not familiar and we didn’t seem to be anywhere near our original spot. Finally,
                we resorted to knocking on a door, and a lady told us some directions to a side entrance. She was eating grapes, which looked delicious since my water ran out at that point.
            </p>
            <p>
                We ended up getting back to our car and headed back home in relief. Although in the moment, the whole situation was frightening, looking back, it was quite the adventure.
            </p>
