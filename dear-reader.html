                <h1>A Letter to You, the Reader</h1>
                <p>
                    Although much of this year consisted of work, a large portion of my time was devoted to mini escapes
                    through travel or exploring nature. Seth Godin, a prominent author and entrepreneur, advises to “set
                    up a life you don’t need to escape from.” I agree with this; however, I enjoy spending time away to relax,
                    but at the same time love learning at school. This year, I tried to create a balance through focusing on school or
                    work when needed, and pursuing my passions on the side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I discovered that we have a lot more free time than we believe. Everyone has 24 hours in a day, yet some
                    let time drift away until there is none left, while others can make the most out of it. I’ve been making an
                    effort to disconnect, as despite not owning a smartphone, when working on a project I tend to get carried away
                    by the depths of the internet. We live in an age where technology is almost too accessible, making real experiences
                    rarer and rarer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our society is so caught up in maximizing output that we often forget to take time for ourselves. For me, this is just
                    the beginning, as I hope these mini travels lead to much larger ones in the future. Even locally, there are dozens of
                    unknown territories created by nature waiting for me to find. Here’s to the adventures to come!
