            <h1>A Trip to Hong Kong</h1>
            <p><strong> DECEMBER 2017</strong> ||| <strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g294217-Hong_Kong-Vacations.html"><i>Tripadvisor</i></a></p>
            <p>I travelled to Hong Kong, China for about three weeks. This was the first time I was there after over 15 years. The last time I was in Hong Kong or even Asia was when I was one year old.
            I've always wanted to go back, but we never made the plans. In addition, the trip was rather spontaneous, as we only booked the flight and hotel two weeks ahead.</p>
            <p> This was also the first time I ever left school for so long. At first, I was a bit worried about the work I would have to make up and the content I was missing.
            However, I think that I was able to catch up reasonably fast.</p>
            <p>It was amazing to get to meet some of my relatives in person for the first time, or see how they have grown. I was also able to spend quality time with my mom, as
            we went together while the rest of my family stayed home. We don't usually make long trips like this one, so I'm looking forward to doing it more often in the future!</p>
