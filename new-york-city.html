            <h1>A Mini Reunion</h1>
            <p><strong> OCTOBER 2017</strong> ||| <strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.sakagura.com/"><i>Sakagura</i></a></p>
            <p>
                Other than my trip in February, I've only been to Hong Kong as a baby, where I lived there for nearly a year.
                Since then, I grew much farther from my relatives than I'd like. So this year, I wanted to make an effort to reconnect with them and form relationships with my many aunts, uncles, and cousins.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I heard that my cousin was studying in Boston to advance his medical career, we immediately wanted to visit him. He's the oldest cousin in my extended family,
                but I never truly got to know him. At first, we were going to drive to Boston to meet up with him. I was looking forward to the road trip, as I love exploring new places!
                However, he wanted to also see the city and connect with my aunt, who lives in Queens, which worked out for us too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before he arrived, we planned out the day extensively. Although we visit the city often, we don't see it through a tourist perspective. We browsed through all sorts of planning websites like
                Tripadvisor and USNews to find the best places to visit and restaurants to eat at.
            </p>
            <p>
                We ended up choosing a Greek place for lunch, and a Japanese restaurant, Sakagura, for dinner. It was hidden underground behind an office building, and after reaching the area, we spent over
                10 minutes just trying to find the restaurant! They even call themselves NYC's "hidden gem."
