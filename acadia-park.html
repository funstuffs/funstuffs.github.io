            <h1>Hiking at Acadia</h1>
            <p><strong> MARCH-APRIL 2018</strong> ||| <strong>URL:</strong> <a href="http://atlanticeyrielodge.com/"><i>Atlantic Eyrie Lodge</i></a></p>
            <p>Last year, I purchased a shirt with an "Acadia National Park" design on the front. I never went to Maine, much less visited the actual national park. In August,
                we finally booked a trip to the park and my t-shirt would no longer be irrelevant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Researching on Kayak and TripAdvisor, my dad chose the hotel we would stay at. He chose the Atlantic Eyrie Lodge in Bar Harbor, Maine, because it was close to the town center, and just a short drive away from most of the hiking locations.
                After driving over nine hours straight, once we got to the hotel, due to the rustic feel, I wished we stayed elsewhere. As the trip progressed, the hotel grew on me.
            </p>
            <p>
                A lady at the front desk of the lodge gave us a guide for exploring the national park. We went to over half of all the trails offered, and after two weeks of hiking, my legs were sore and shoes were worn out. The trails were full of climbs,
                scenic views, and exposed but thrilling cliffs. Since we went in August, it was peak season for blueberries, which we picked for fuel along each hike.
            </p>
            <p>
                As my shoes were not made for hiking, they were slippery at times. Therefore, after a couple days of hiking, we spent an afternoon searching for hiking shoes. We did not find any shoes that I was comfortable in. On the bright side,
                we did find an amazing Jamaican shack - Taste Jamaica! We discovered the restaurant through Google Maps. It was small business run by a Jamaican couple. The authentic Jamaican food they served was just as delicious as the lobster
                in Maine. Impressed by the food and service, we even left a review on Google!
